After connecting Notion to Checkify.so, the next step is to create a to-do list
by using a database in your Notion account. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. On the same page where you connected Notion to Checkify.so, search and select
   the database that you want to extract all your checkboxes from.

> **NOTE**
>
> If your database does not show up in the selection panel, it might be because
> it is still being synced. Wait for 1-2 minutes and search again.

2. A new item will appear in the panel labeled "My Todo Lists" below the search
   bar. Click the copy button to copy URL you'll use for the embed.

3. Once you've copied the link, go to your Notion page and paste the link as an
   embed.
